# Distributed differentially private energy management of virtual power plants
Codes for "Distributed differentially private energy management of virtual power plants"

There are three different folders that represent different optimization schemes with the same data.

## Centralized optimization
Results serve as the benchmark for VPP's decision-making.

## Distributed optimization
Results show the concergence for the distributed scheme.

## Distributed differentially private optimization
Results show the impact of the added noise in dual variable.
